= Aegis - A complete authorization solution for Rails

Aegis is an authorization solution for Ruby on Rails that supports roles and a RESTish, resource-style declaration of
permission rules. Getting started with Aegis is easy and requires very little integration. As your authorization
requirements become more complex, Aegis will grow with you.


== Getting started

All your permissions live in a single class <tt>Permissions</tt>.
Permissions are described using <tt>resources</tt>, similiar to your routes.
Your permission resources can match those in your routes, but don't have to.

Access to resources or individual actions can be granted or denied to specific roles.

  class Permissions < Aegis::Permissions

    role :user
    role :admin

    resources :projects do
      allow :everyone
    end

    resources :users do
      allow :admin
    end

  end

To give your user model a role, it needs to have an attribute +role_name+. The <tt>has_role</tt> macro wires everything together:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_role
  end

You can now check if a user has permission to access a given action in your controllers and views:
    
  <% if current_user.may_update_project? @project %>
    <%= link_to 'Edit', edit_project_path(@project) %>
  <% end %>

You can protect all actions in a controller through an Aegis resource with a single line:

  class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
    permissions :projects
  end
